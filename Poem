/* 
Wanderer's Song

Beneath the skyâ€™s endless blue, I roam,
With whispers of winds, I find my home.
In paths untold, where shadows play,
I chase the sun, then night turns gray.

The trees, they hum with secrets old,
Of tales forgotten, yet softly told.
Each step I take, the earth replies,
In echoes faint, like lullabies.

No destination, no map, no guide,
Just rivers to cross and stars to ride.
For in the journey, I find my way,
In every dusk, in every day.
